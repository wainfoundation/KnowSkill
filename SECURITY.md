# Security Policy for KnowSkill üîí

## Introduction

Security is a top priority for **KnowSkill**, a decentralized learning platform powered by the **Pi Network**. We strive to maintain the highest levels of security in our codebase, user data, and transactions. This document outlines the security practices, guidelines, and protocols for contributors, users, and developers to ensure the protection of sensitive data and platform integrity.

## üì° Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you‚Äôve discovered a security vulnerability in **KnowSkill**, please report it immediately. We encourage responsible disclosure and follow a **bug bounty** program. Here's how you can report a security issue:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to [security@knowskill.com].
2. **Security Contact**: For urgent security issues, contact [security@knowskill.com] with the subject line **URGENT: Security Vulnerability Report**.
3. **Disclosure Guidelines**: Please include any relevant information such as:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any related logs, screenshots, or technical details.

We will respond to all reports and work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

## üîê Secure Code Practices

We follow best practices to keep the codebase secure. Some of the key practices include:

1. **Encryption**:
   - **AES-256** for encrypting sensitive data at rest (user data, Pi transactions).
   - **SSL/TLS** for encrypting all communications between users and servers (HTTPS).

2. **Key Management**:
   - **Private Keys** used for Pi Network transactions should **never be stored** on the server. Only encrypted tokens should be passed through the network.
   - Use **environment variables** for sensitive credentials and API keys.

3. **Smart Contract Audits**:
   - All smart contracts interacting with the Pi Network undergo third-party **security audits** before being deployed on the blockchain.
   - We maintain a **minimum-risk** approach to smart contract interactions to minimize the potential for exploits.

4. **Code Review**:
   - All contributions to the repository undergo a **rigorous code review** process.
   - Automated code analysis tools such as **SonarQube**, **ESLint**, and **Snyk** are used to scan for vulnerabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Developers

Developers contributing to the **KnowSkill** codebase should adhere to the following security best practices:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Use **OAuth2** or **JWT tokens** for secure user authentication.
   - Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for different user roles (admin, course creator, student).

2. **Input Validation**:
   - All inputs (especially from untrusted users) should be validated and sanitized to prevent **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.
   - Use libraries like **express-validator** and **Joi** to help sanitize and validate inputs.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Implement **secure cookies** for session management and ensure that they are **HTTP-only** and **SameSite**.
   - Set an **expiration time** for all authentication tokens.

4. **Regular Dependency Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies and libraries up to date, using tools like **Dependabot** or **npm audit** to identify and patch vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
   - Avoid using deprecated or unmaintained packages.

## üîç Vulnerability Scanning & Testing

1. **Static Code Analysis**: We regularly use static code analysis tools such as **SonarQube** and **ESLint** to identify potential security flaws in the codebase.
2. **Automated Vulnerability Scanning**: Tools like **OWASP ZAP**, **Snyk**, and **WhiteSource** are used to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies.
3. **Penetration Testing**: We perform periodic penetration testing on the platform, including both **backend** and **frontend** security assessments.
4. **Bug Bounty Program**: We encourage researchers to participate in our **bug bounty program**, offering rewards for identified vulnerabilities.

## üîë Data Privacy

We take data privacy seriously and follow industry best practices to ensure user data is protected:

1. **User Data Encryption**:
   - Personal information (emails, names, etc.) is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
   - **Pi Wallet** keys and other sensitive information are **never** stored in the database and are always handled using secure methods.

2. **GDPR Compliance**:
   - We are fully compliant with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** for users in the EU. Users have the right to access, update, and delete their personal data.

3. **Data Retention**:
   - We only retain user data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.
   - Users can request a full deletion of their data through the platform.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Secure Development Environment

To ensure the security of your development environment when contributing to **KnowSkill**, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Use **secure and trusted development environments** like Docker for isolated environments.
   - Regularly update your local development environment and keep all packages up to date.

2. **Code Signing**:
   - Use **GPG/PGP** to sign commits and tags to ensure code integrity and authenticity.
   - Ensure contributors‚Äô commits are **verified** to prevent unauthorized code changes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Security

1. **Secret Management**: Use **secret managers** (like **Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**) to securely store sensitive keys and credentials in the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Automated Tests**: Every commit and pull request triggers an automated build and security test in our **CI/CD** pipeline to ensure that no vulnerabilities are introduced.
3. **Secure Deployment**: Use **immutable infrastructure** for deployment to avoid the risk of malicious code injection during deployment.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Community Guidelines

As part of our commitment to security, we ask all community members to follow these guidelines:

- **Be transparent**: Share your concerns and findings responsibly.
- **Respect privacy**: Do not attempt unauthorized access to users‚Äô data or private keys.
- **Report responsibly**: Follow our guidelines to report security issues in a responsible manner.
